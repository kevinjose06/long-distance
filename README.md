### Project Description  
Distance Doesn’t Delete Love is a web application designed specifically for long-distance couples to stay emotionally connected despite physical separation.
When partners move to different cities or countries for education or work, emotional distance often grows unintentionally. Our platform provides meaningful digital tools that strengthen emotional bonding and reduce feelings of loneliness in long-distance relationships.

### The Problem Statement  
Long-distance relationships often struggle due to emotional disconnect, lack of shared experiences, and limited real-time emotional awareness. Messaging apps don’t actively help couples preserve memories or communicate feelings deeply.

### The Solution  
We built a lightweight web app that allows couples to preserve emotional memories, express feelings instantly, play bonding quizzes, and enjoy virtual movie dates together even when physically apart.
